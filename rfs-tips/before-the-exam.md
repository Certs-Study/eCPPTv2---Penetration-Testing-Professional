# ðŸŸ¢ Before the Exam

Before starting the exam I recommend you to sleep well and after that have a great meal.

Remember to **Take a shower** before the Exam and clean your desk.

Go to the supermarket and buy some food and drinks for yourself and if you have a pet like me buy to it too.

If you have anything in your mind to do, do it before starting the exam. Just clean your head!

### Coffee?&#x20;

Reload the machine, and if you smoke buy all the stuff you need.

### Mobile Phone

Just turn it off while you are Hacking!

### Backups

Before starting, the exam verifies if you have backups of all virtual machines you need or tools, documentation, and binaries.
